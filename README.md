# Covid-19-Forcast-APP

You have been tasked to gather COVID-19 data from the API of your choice that contains both noise and valuable data. After that, you will clean and pre-process the data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights, and select the best-suited supervised algorithm to predict the future number of cases. Finally, you will deploy the model using Streamlit.

Instructions
Choose a COVID-19 API of your choice that contains both valuable data and noise.
Use Python to gather the data from the API and store it in a Pandas DataFrame.
Clean the data by removing any irrelevant columns, null values, or duplicates.
Pre-process the data by normalizing and scaling the numerical data.
Perform EDA to identify trends, correlations, and patterns in the data. Use visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to help you understand the data better.
Choose the best-suited supervised algorithm to predict the future number of cases. Use techniques such as train-test split, cross-validation, and grid search to optimize the model's performance.
Once you have chosen the best-suited model, deploy it using Streamlit. Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to input data and view the model's predictions.
Deploy your streamlit app with streamlit share
Hints:

Use the requests library to fetch data from the API.
Use the Pandas library to store the data in a DataFrame and clean it.
Use the plotly  library to create visualizations.
Use the Scikit-learn library to build and optimize the model.
Use the Streamlit library to create the user interface.
